## 269 Alien Dictionary

### 原题概述

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** words from the dictionary, where **words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]

Output: "wertf"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
[
  "z",
  "x"
]

Output: "zx"
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input:
[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
] 

Output: "" 

Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
```

**Note:**

1. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
2. You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
3. If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
4. There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.

### 题意和分析

这道题让给了我们一些按“字母顺序”排列的单词，但是这个字母顺序不是我们熟知的顺序，而是另类的顺序，让我们根据这些“有序”的单词来找出新的字母顺序，这实际上是一道有向图的问题。跟207 Couurse Schedule，210 Couurse Schedule II和630 Couurse ScheduleIII类似。
