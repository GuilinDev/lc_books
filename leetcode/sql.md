## 176 Second Highest Salary

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```text
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```text
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Salary int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('1', '100')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('2', '200')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('3', '300')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# if need any 3rd or 4th or Nth value, can increase the first value followed by 
# LIMIT (n-1) ie. for 4th salary : LIMIT 3, 1;
select distinct(salary) as SecondHighestSalary from employee 
order by salary desc limit 1, 1
```

```sql
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary from employee 
where salary < (select max(salary) from employee)
```

## 175 Combine Two Tables

Table: `Person`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Table: `Address`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

### Schema

```sql
Create table Person (PersonId int, FirstName varchar(255), LastName varchar(255))
Create table Address (AddressId int, PersonId int, City varchar(255), State varchar(255))
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (PersonId, LastName, FirstName) values ('1', 'Wang', 'Allen')
Truncate table Address
insert into Address (AddressId, PersonId, City, State) values ('1', '2', 'New York City', 'New York')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a.FirstName, a.LastName, b.city, b.State from Person a
left join Address b on a.PersonID = b.PersonId
```

## 177 Nth Highest Salary

Write a SQL query to get the _n_th highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```text
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the _n_th highest salary where _n_ = 2 is `200`. If there is no _n_th highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```text
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```

### Solution

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  DECLARE M INT;
  SET M = N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      select DISTINCT salary from Employee order by salary DESC limit M, 1
  );
END
```

## 185 Department Top 3 Salaries

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```text
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

```text
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows \(order of rows does not matter\).

```text
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

**Explanation:**

In IT department, Max earns the highest salary, both Randy and Joe earn the second highest salary, and Will earns the third highest salary. There are only two employees in the Sales department, Henry earns the highest salary while Sam earns the second highest salary.

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, DepartmentId int)
Create table If Not Exists Department (Id int, Name varchar(255))
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('1', 'Joe', '85000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('5', 'Janet', '69000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('6', 'Randy', '85000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('7', 'Will', '70000', '1')
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('1', 'IT')
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('2', 'Sales')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# 注意alias
Select b.Name as Department, a.Name as Employee, a.Salary as Salary 
from Employee a, Department b 
where a.DepartmentId = b.Id 
    and
    (select count(distinct Salary) from Employee 
    where DepartmentId = b.Id and Salary > a.Salary) < 3

```

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select d.Name Department, e1.Name Employee, e1.Salary
from Employee e1 
join Department d
on e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
where (select count(distinct(e2.Salary)) 
                  from Employee e2 
                  where e2.Salary > e1.Salary 
                  and e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
                  ) < 3;

```

## 181 Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```text
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```

Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

```text
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, ManagerId int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '3')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '4')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', 'None')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', 'None')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select e1.Name as Employee from Employee e1, Employee e2 
where e1.ManagerId = e2.Id and e1.Salary > e2.Salary
```

## 184 Department Highest Salary

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```text
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

```text
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows \(order of rows does not matter\).

```text
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

**Explanation:**

Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, DepartmentId int)
Create table If Not Exists Department (Id int, Name varchar(255))
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('2', 'Jim', '90000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('3', 'Henry', '80000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('4', 'Sam', '60000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('5', 'Max', '90000', '1')
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('1', 'IT')
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('2', 'Sales')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select d.Name Department, e1.Name Employee, e1.Salary
from Employee e1 
join Department d
on e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
# find top 1
where (select count(distinct(e2.Salary)) 
                  from Employee e2 
                  where e2.Salary > e1.Salary 
                  and e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
                  ) < 1;
```

## 262 Trips and Users

Table: `Trips`

```text
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Id          | int      |
| Client_Id   | int      |
| Driver_Id   | int      |
| City_Id     | int      |
| Status      | enum     |
| Request_at  | date     |     
+-------------+----------+
Id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table.
Status is an ENUM type of (‘completed’, ‘cancelled_by_driver’, ‘cancelled_by_client’).
```

Table: `Users`

```text
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Users_Id    | int      |
| Banned      | enum     |
| Role        | enum     |
+-------------+----------+
Users_Id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique Users_Id, and Role is an ENUM type of (‘client’, ‘driver’, ‘partner’).
Status is an ENUM type of (‘Yes’, ‘No’).
```

Write a SQL query to find the **cancellation rate** of requests with unbanned users \(**both client and driver must not be banned**\) each day between `"2013-10-01"` and `"2013-10-03"`.

The **cancellation rate** is computed by dividing the number of canceled \(by client or driver\) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Return the result table in any order. Round `Cancellation Rate` to **two decimal** points.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Trips table:
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+
| Id | Client_Id | Driver_Id | City_Id | Status              | Request_at |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+
| 1  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 2  | 2         | 11        | 1       | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-01 |
| 3  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 4  | 4         | 13        | 6       | cancelled_by_client | 2013-10-01 |
| 5  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 6  | 2         | 11        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 7  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 8  | 2         | 12        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 9  | 3         | 10        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 10 | 4         | 13        | 12      | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-03 |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+

Users table:
+----------+--------+--------+
| Users_Id | Banned | Role   |
+----------+--------+--------+
| 1        | No     | client |
| 2        | Yes    | client |
| 3        | No     | client |
| 4        | No     | client |
| 10       | No     | driver |
| 11       | No     | driver |
| 12       | No     | driver |
| 13       | No     | driver |
+----------+--------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+-------------------+
| Day        | Cancellation Rate |
+------------+-------------------+
| 2013-10-01 | 0.33              |
| 2013-10-02 | 0.00              |
| 2013-10-03 | 0.50              |
+------------+-------------------+

On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50
```
