# SQL\_1

## 176 Second Highest Salary

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```text
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```text
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Salary int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('1', '100')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('2', '200')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('3', '300')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# if need any 3rd or 4th or Nth value, can increase the first value followed by 
# LIMIT (n-1) ie. for 4th salary : LIMIT 3, 1;
select distinct(salary) as SecondHighestSalary from employee 
order by salary desc limit 1, 1
```

```sql
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary from employee 
where salary < (select max(salary) from employee)
```

## 175 Combine Two Tables

Table: `Person`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Table: `Address`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

### Schema

```sql
Create table Person (PersonId int, FirstName varchar(255), LastName varchar(255))
Create table Address (AddressId int, PersonId int, City varchar(255), State varchar(255))
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (PersonId, LastName, FirstName) values ('1', 'Wang', 'Allen')
Truncate table Address
insert into Address (AddressId, PersonId, City, State) values ('1', '2', 'New York City', 'New York')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a.FirstName, a.LastName, b.city, b.State from Person a
left join Address b on a.PersonID = b.PersonId
```

## 177 Nth Highest Salary

Write a SQL query to get the _n_th highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```text
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the _n_th highest salary where _n_ = 2 is `200`. If there is no _n_th highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```text
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```

### Solution

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  DECLARE M INT;
  SET M = N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      select DISTINCT salary from Employee order by salary DESC limit M, 1
  );
END
```

## 185 Department Top 3 Salaries

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```text
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

```text
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows \(order of rows does not matter\).

```text
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

**Explanation:**

In IT department, Max earns the highest salary, both Randy and Joe earn the second highest salary, and Will earns the third highest salary. There are only two employees in the Sales department, Henry earns the highest salary while Sam earns the second highest salary.

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, DepartmentId int)
Create table If Not Exists Department (Id int, Name varchar(255))
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('1', 'Joe', '85000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('5', 'Janet', '69000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('6', 'Randy', '85000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('7', 'Will', '70000', '1')
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('1', 'IT')
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('2', 'Sales')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# 注意alias
Select b.Name as Department, a.Name as Employee, a.Salary as Salary 
from Employee a, Department b 
where a.DepartmentId = b.Id 
    and
    (select count(distinct Salary) from Employee 
    where DepartmentId = b.Id and Salary > a.Salary) < 3

```

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select d.Name Department, e1.Name Employee, e1.Salary
from Employee e1 
join Department d
on e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
where (select count(distinct(e2.Salary)) 
                  from Employee e2 
                  where e2.Salary > e1.Salary 
                  and e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
                  ) < 3;

```

## 181 Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```text
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```

Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

```text
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, ManagerId int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '3')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '4')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', 'None')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', 'None')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select e1.Name as Employee from Employee e1, Employee e2 
where e1.ManagerId = e2.Id and e1.Salary > e2.Salary
```

## 184 Department Highest Salary

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```text
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

```text
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows \(order of rows does not matter\).

```text
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

**Explanation:**

Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, DepartmentId int)
Create table If Not Exists Department (Id int, Name varchar(255))
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('2', 'Jim', '90000', '1')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('3', 'Henry', '80000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('4', 'Sam', '60000', '2')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId) values ('5', 'Max', '90000', '1')
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('1', 'IT')
insert into Department (Id, Name) values ('2', 'Sales')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select d.Name Department, e1.Name Employee, e1.Salary
from Employee e1 
join Department d
on e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
# find top 1
where (select count(distinct(e2.Salary)) 
                  from Employee e2 
                  where e2.Salary > e1.Salary 
                  and e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
                  ) < 1;
```

## 262 Trips and Users

Table: `Trips`

```text
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Id          | int      |
| Client_Id   | int      |
| Driver_Id   | int      |
| City_Id     | int      |
| Status      | enum     |
| Request_at  | date     |     
+-------------+----------+
Id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table.
Status is an ENUM type of (‘completed’, ‘cancelled_by_driver’, ‘cancelled_by_client’).
```

Table: `Users`

```text
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Users_Id    | int      |
| Banned      | enum     |
| Role        | enum     |
+-------------+----------+
Users_Id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique Users_Id, and Role is an ENUM type of (‘client’, ‘driver’, ‘partner’).
Status is an ENUM type of (‘Yes’, ‘No’).
```

Write a SQL query to find the **cancellation rate** of requests with unbanned users \(**both client and driver must not be banned**\) each day between `"2013-10-01"` and `"2013-10-03"`.

The **cancellation rate** is computed by dividing the number of canceled \(by client or driver\) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Return the result table in any order. Round `Cancellation Rate` to **two decimal** points.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Trips table:
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+
| Id | Client_Id | Driver_Id | City_Id | Status              | Request_at |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+
| 1  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 2  | 2         | 11        | 1       | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-01 |
| 3  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 4  | 4         | 13        | 6       | cancelled_by_client | 2013-10-01 |
| 5  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 6  | 2         | 11        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 7  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 8  | 2         | 12        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 9  | 3         | 10        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 10 | 4         | 13        | 12      | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-03 |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+

Users table:
+----------+--------+--------+
| Users_Id | Banned | Role   |
+----------+--------+--------+
| 1        | No     | client |
| 2        | Yes    | client |
| 3        | No     | client |
| 4        | No     | client |
| 10       | No     | driver |
| 11       | No     | driver |
| 12       | No     | driver |
| 13       | No     | driver |
+----------+--------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+-------------------+
| Day        | Cancellation Rate |
+------------+-------------------+
| 2013-10-01 | 0.33              |
| 2013-10-02 | 0.00              |
| 2013-10-03 | 0.50              |
+------------+-------------------+

On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Trips (Id int, Client_Id int, Driver_Id int, City_Id int, Status ENUM('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client'), Request_at varchar(50))
Create table If Not Exists Users (Users_Id int, Banned varchar(50), Role ENUM('client', 'driver', 'partner'))
Truncate table Trips
insert into Trips (Id, Client_Id, Driver_Id, City_Id, Status, Request_at) values ('1', '1', '10', '1', 'completed', '2013-10-01')
insert into Trips (Id, Client_Id, Driver_Id, City_Id, Status, Request_at) values ('2', '2', '11', '1', 'cancelled_by_driver', '2013-10-01')
insert into Trips (Id, Client_Id, Driver_Id, City_Id, Status, Request_at) values ('3', '3', '12', '6', 'completed', '2013-10-01')

insert into Users (Users_Id, Banned, Role) values ('12', 'No', 'driver')
insert into Users (Users_Id, Banned, Role) values ('13', 'No', 'driver')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Request_at as Day,
       ROUND(COUNT(IF(Status != 'completed', TRUE, NULL)) / COUNT(*), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips
WHERE (Request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03')
      AND Client_id NOT IN (SELECT Users_Id FROM Users WHERE Banned = 'Yes')
GROUP BY Request_at;
```

## 178 Rank Score

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```text
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```

For example, given the above `Scores` table, your query should generate the following report \(order by highest score\):

```text
+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+
```

**Important Note:** For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. For example **\`Rank\`**.

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Scores (Id int, Score DECIMAL(3,2))
Truncate table Scores
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('1', '3.5')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('2', '3.65')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('3', '4.0')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('4', '3.85')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('5', '4.0')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('6', '3.65')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
  Score,
  (SELECT count(distinct Score) FROM Scores WHERE Score >= s.Score) 'Rank'
FROM Scores s
ORDER BY Score desc
```

优化

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
  Score,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM (SELECT distinct Score s FROM Scores) tmp WHERE s >= Score) 'Rank'
FROM Scores
ORDER BY Score desc
```

## 1270 All People Report to the Given Manager

Table: `Employees`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
```

Write an SQL query to find `employee_id` of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers will not exceed 3 managers as the company is small.

Return result table in any order without duplicates.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+

Result table:

## 627 Swap Salary

Table: `Salary`

```text
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| sex         | ENUM     |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
The sex column is ENUM value of type ('m', 'f').
The table contains information about an employee.
```

Write an SQL query to swap all `'f'` and `'m'` values \(i.e., change all `'f'` values to `'m'` and vice versa\) with a **single update statement** and no intermediate temp table\(s\).

Note that you must write a single update statement, **DO NOT** write any select statement for this problem.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Salary table:
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+

Result table:
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+
(1, A) and (3, C) were changed from 'm' to 'f'.
(2, B) and (4, D) were changed from 'f' to 'm'.
```

### Schema

```sql
create table if not exists salary(id int, name varchar(100), sex char(1), salary int)
Truncate table salary
insert into salary (id, name, sex, salary) values ('1', 'A', 'm', '2500')
insert into salary (id, name, sex, salary) values ('2', 'B', 'f', '1500')
insert into salary (id, name, sex, salary) values ('3', 'C', 'm', '5500')
insert into salary (id, name, sex, salary) values ('4', 'D', 'f', '500')
```

### Solution

Case When

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Update Salary
    Set sex = (Case When sex = 'm'
              Then 'f'
              Else 'm'
              End)
```

IF函数

```sql
Update Salary
    Set sex = IF(sex = 'm', 'f', 'm')
```

## 196 Delete Duplicate Emails

Write a SQL query to **delete** all duplicate email entries in a table named `Person`, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest **Id**.

```text
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
```

For example, after running your query, the above `Person` table should have the following rows:

```text
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```

**Note:**

Your output is the whole `Person` table after executing your sql. Use `delete` statement.

### Schema

```sql
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('1', 'john@example.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('2', 'bob@example.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('3', 'john@example.com')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Delete from Person Where Id not in (
    Select tmp.Id from (
        Select min(Id) as Id from Person Group By email
    ) tmp
)
```

## 610 Triangle Judgement

 A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.

 However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.

 Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, assuming table `triangle` holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.

```text
| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
```

For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:

```text
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists triangle (x int, y int, z int)
Truncate table triangle
insert into triangle (x, y, z) values ('13', '15', '30')
insert into triangle (x, y, z) values ('10', '20', '15')
```

### Solution

Case When

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select *, 
    Case When
        x + y > z and
        x + z > y and
        y + z > z
    Then 'Yes'
    Else 'No'
    End As 'Triangle'
From Triangle
```

IF函数

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select *, IF(x + y > z and x + z > y and y + z > x, 'Yes', 'No') as 'triangle'
From triangle
```

## 626 Exchange Seats

Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table `seat` storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column **id** is continuous increment.

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

```text
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

For the sample input, the output is:

```text
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

**Note:**

If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists seat(id int, student varchar(255))
Truncate table seat
insert into seat (id, student) values ('1', 'Abbot')
insert into seat (id, student) values ('2', 'Doris')
insert into seat (id, student) values ('3', 'Emerson')
insert into seat (id, student) values ('4', 'Green')
insert into seat (id, student) values ('5', 'Jeames')
```

### Solution

Case When

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN seat.id % 2 <> 0 AND seat.id = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM seat) THEN seat.id
		WHEN seat.id % 2 = 0 THEN seat.id - 1
		ELSE
			seat.id + 1
	END as id,
	student 
FROM seat
ORDER BY id
;
```

IF函数

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select
IF(id < (Select count(*) from seat), IF(id mod 2 = 0, id - 1, id + 1), if(id mod 2 = 0, id - 1, id)) as id, student
From seat
Order by id Asc;
```

## 1179 Reformat Department Table

Table: `Department`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| revenue       | int     |
| month         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
```

Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column **for each month**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Department table:
+------+---------+-------+
| id   | revenue | month |
+------+---------+-------+
| 1    | 8000    | Jan   |
| 2    | 9000    | Jan   |
| 3    | 10000   | Feb   |
| 1    | 7000    | Feb   |
| 1    | 6000    | Mar   |
+------+---------+-------+

Result table:
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| id   | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue | Mar_Revenue | ... | Dec_Revenue |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| 1    | 8000        | 7000        | 6000        | ... | null        |
| 2    | 9000        | null        | null        | ... | null        |
| 3    | null        | 10000       | null        | ... | null        |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+

Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Department (id int, revenue int, month varchar(5))
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('1', '8000', 'Jan')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('2', '9000', 'Jan')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('3', '10000', 'Feb')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('1', '7000', 'Feb')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('1', '6000', 'Mar')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select id, 
	sum(case when month = 'jan' then revenue else null end) as Jan_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'feb' then revenue else null end) as Feb_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'mar' then revenue else null end) as Mar_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'apr' then revenue else null end) as Apr_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'may' then revenue else null end) as May_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'jun' then revenue else null end) as Jun_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'jul' then revenue else null end) as Jul_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'aug' then revenue else null end) as Aug_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'sep' then revenue else null end) as Sep_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'oct' then revenue else null end) as Oct_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'nov' then revenue else null end) as Nov_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'dec' then revenue else null end) as Dec_Revenue
from department

## 1412 Find the Quiet Students in All Exams

Table: `Student`

```text
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| student_id          | int     |
| student_name        | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
student_name is the name of the student.
```

Table: `Exam`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| exam_id       | int     |
| student_id    | int     |
| score         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(exam_id, student_id) is the primary key for this table.
Student with student_id got score points in exam with id exam_id.
```

A "quite" student is the one who took at least one exam and didn't score neither the high score nor the low score.

Write an SQL query to report the students \(student\_id, student\_name\) being "quiet" in **ALL** exams.

Don't return the student who has never taken any exam. Return the result table **ordered** by student\_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

```text
Student table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |
| 2           | Jade          |

| 10         |     3        |    90     |
| 20         |     1        |    80     |
| 30         |     1        |    70     |
| 30         |     3        |    80     |
| 30         |     4        |    90     |

| 40         |     2        |    70     |
| 40         |     4        |    80     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 2           | Jade          |
+-------------+---------------+

For exam 1: Student 1 and 3 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
For exam 2: Student 1 hold both highest and lowest score.
For exam 3 and 4: Studnet 1 and 4 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
Student 2 and 5 have never got the highest or lowest in any of the exam.
Since student 5 is not taking any exam, he is excluded from the result.
So, we only return the information of Student 2.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Student (student_id int, student_name varchar(30))
Create table If Not Exists Exam (exam_id int, student_id int, score int)
Truncate table Student
insert into Student (student_id, student_name) values ('1', 'Daniel')

insert into Exam (exam_id, student_id, score) values ('40', '2', '70')
insert into Exam (exam_id, student_id, score) values ('40', '4', '80')
```

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte AS(
    SELECT exam_id, exam.student_id, student_name, score, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY exam_id ORDER BY score) rk1, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY exam_id ORDER BY score DESC) rk2 
    FROM exam LEFT JOIN student
    ON exam.student_id = student.student_id

+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
```

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+

| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```

### Schema

## 601 Human Traffic of Stadiums

Table: `Stadium`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
| people        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
visit_date is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
No two rows will have the same visit_date, and as the id increases, the dates increase as well.
```

Write an SQL query to display the records with three or more rows with **consecutive** `id`'s, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by `visit_date` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

```text
Stadium table:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+

Result table:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
The four rows with ids 5, 6, 7, and 8 have consecutive ids and each of them has >= 100 people attended. Note that row 8 was included even though the visit_date was not the next day after row 7.
The rows with ids 2 and 3 are not included because we need at least three consecutive ids.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists stadium (id int, visit_date DATE NULL, people int)
Truncate table stadium
insert into stadium (id, visit_date, people) values ('1', '2017-01-01', '10')

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the `Customers` table and the `Orders` table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: `Customers`.

```text
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```

Table: `Orders`.

```text
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

```text
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Customers (Id int, Name varchar(255))
Create table If Not Exists Orders (Id int, CustomerId int)
Truncate table Customers
insert into Customers (Id, Name) values ('1', 'Joe')
insert into Customers (Id, Name) values ('2', 'Henry')
insert into Customers (Id, Name) values ('3', 'Sam')
insert into Customers (Id, Name) values ('4', 'Max')
Truncate table Orders
insert into Orders (Id, CustomerId) values ('1', '3')
insert into Orders (Id, CustomerId) values ('2', '1')
```

### Solution

```sql
SELECT A.Name as 'Customers' from Customers A
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Orders B WHERE A.Id = B.CustomerId)
```

```sql
SELECT A.Name as 'Customers' from Customers A
WHERE A.Id NOT IN (SELECT B.CustomerId from Orders B)
```

```sql
SELECT A.Name as 'Customers' from Customers A
LEFT JOIN Orders B on  a.Id = B.CustomerId
WHERE b.CustomerId is NULL
```

## 1757 Recyclable and Low Fat Products

Table: `Products`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
```

Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |

Truncate table Products
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('0', 'Y', 'N')
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('1', 'Y', 'Y')
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('2', 'N', 'Y')
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('3', 'Y', 'Y')
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('4', 'N', 'N')
```

### Solution

```sql
SELECT product_id FROM Products 
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y' 
ORDER BY 1 ASC # 按Select后的第一列排序

## 1741 Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee

Table: `Employees`

```text
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| emp_id      | int  |
| event_day   | date |
| in_time     | int  |
| out_time    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key of this table.
The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.
event_day is the day at which this event happened, in_time is the minute at which the employee entered the office, and out_time is the minute at which they left the office.
in_time and out_time are between 1 and 1440.
It is guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time, and in_time < out_time.
```

Write an SQL query to calculate the total time **in minutes** spent by each employee on each day at the office. Note that within one day, an employee can enter and leave more than once. The time spent in the office for a single entry is `out_time - in_time`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Employees table:
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
| emp_id | event_day  | in_time | out_time |
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 4       | 32       |
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 55      | 200      |
| 1      | 2020-12-03 | 1       | 42       |
| 2      | 2020-11-28 | 3       | 33       |
| 2      | 2020-12-09 | 47      | 74       |
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
Result table:
+------------+--------+------------+
| day        | emp_id | total_time |
+------------+--------+------------+
| 2020-11-28 | 1      | 173        |
| 2020-11-28 | 2      | 30         |
| 2020-12-03 | 1      | 41         |
| 2020-12-09 | 2      | 27         |
+------------+--------+------------+
Employee 1 has three events: two on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (32 - 4) + (200 - 55) = 173, and one on day 2020-12-03 with a total of (42 - 1) = 41.
Employee 2 has two events: one on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (33 - 3) = 30, and one on day 2020-12-09 with a total of (74 - 47) = 27.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employees(emp_id int, event_day date, in_time int, out_time int)
Truncate table Employees
insert into Employees (emp_id, event_day, in_time, out_time) values ('1', '2020-11-28', '4', '32')
insert into Employees (emp_id, event_day, in_time, out_time) values ('1', '2020-11-28', '55', '200')

## 1795 Rearrange Products Table

Table: `Products`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store1      | int     |
| store2      | int     |
| store3      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores: store1, store2, and store3.
If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.
```

Write an SQL query to rearrange the `Products` table so that each row has `(product_id, store, price)`. If a product is not available in a store, do **not** include a row with that `product_id` and `store` combination in the result table.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Products table:
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
| product_id | store1 | store2 | store3 |
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
| 0          | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1          | 70     | null   | 80     |
+------------+--------+--------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+--------+-------+
| product_id | store  | price |
+------------+--------+-------+
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 0          | store2 | 100   |
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |
+------------+--------+-------+

Product 0 is available in all three stores with prices 95, 100, and 105 respectively.
Product 1 is available in store1 with price 70 and store3 with price 80. The product is not available in store2.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Products (product_id int, store1 int, store2 int, store3 int)
Truncate table Products
insert into Products (product_id, store1, store2, store3) values ('0', '95', '100', '105')
insert into Products (product_id, store1, store2, store3) values ('1', '70', 'None', '80')
```

### Solution

考察Union或Union All的用法，后者可以列出重复值

```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store1' AS store, store1 AS price FROM Products WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL
UNION 
SELECT product_id, 'store2' AS store, store2 AS price FROM Products WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL
UNION 
SELECT product_id, 'store3' AS store, store3 AS price FROM Products WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY 1,2 ASC
```

```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Departments (id int, name varchar(30))
Create table If Not Exists Students (id int, name varchar(30), department_id int)
Truncate table Departments
insert into Departments (id, name) values ('1', 'Electrical Engineering')
insert into Departments (id, name) values ('7', 'Computer Engineering')
insert into Departments (id, name) values ('13', 'Bussiness Administration')
Truncate table Students
insert into Students (id, name, department_id) values ('23', 'Alice', '1')
insert into Students (id, name, department_id) values ('1', 'Bob', '7')
insert into Students (id, name, department_id) values ('5', 'Jennifer', '13')

insert into Students (id, name, department_id) values ('7', 'Daiana', '33')
insert into Students (id, name, department_id) values ('11', 'Madelynn', '1')
```

### Solution

sub query

```sql
Select id, name From Students
Where department_id not in (Select id from Departments)
```

outer join，这里的右表是Students

```sql
SELECT s.id, s.name FROM Departments d
RIGHT JOIN Students s
ON d.id = s.department_id
WHERE d.id IS NULL
```

## 1378 Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier

Table: `Employees`

```text
+---------------+---------+

+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the name of an employee in a company.
```

Table: `EmployeeUNI`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(id, unique_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.
```

Write an SQL query to show the **unique ID** of each user, If a user doesn't have a unique ID replace just show null.

Return the result table in **any** order.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Employees table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+

EmployeeUNI table:
+----+-----------+
| id | unique_id |
+----+-----------+
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |
+----+-----------+

Result table:
+-----------+----------+
| unique_id | name     |
+-----------+----------+
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |
+-----------+----------+

Alice and Bob don't have a unique ID, We will show null instead.
The unique ID of Meir is 2.
The unique ID of Winston is 3.
The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employees (id int, name varchar(20))
Create table If Not Exists EmployeeUNI (id int, unique_id int)
Truncate table Employees
insert into Employees (id, name) values ('1', 'Alice')
insert into Employees (id, name) values ('7', 'Bob')
insert into Employees (id, name) values ('11', 'Meir')
insert into Employees (id, name) values ('90', 'Winston')
insert into Employees (id, name) values ('3', 'Jonathan')

insert into EmployeeUNI (id, unique_id) values ('3', '1')
insert into EmployeeUNI (id, unique_id) values ('11', '2')
insert into EmployeeUNI (id, unique_id) values ('90', '3')
```

### Solution

左表是Employees，没有记录得时候用Null补齐

```sql
Select empU.unique_id, emp.name
From Employees emp
Left Join EmployeeUNI empU
On emp.id = empU.id
```

### Solution

先计算某个产品，再计算整个仓库

```sql
Select w.name As WAREHOUSE_NAME, Sum(p.width * p.length * height * w.units) As VOLUME # 某个仓库中某个产品的总体积
From warehouse w
Inner Join products p
On w.product_id = p.product_id
Group By warehouse_name # 仓库里的所有产品体积合成一个
```

子查询先计算出一个产品

```sql
SELECT name warehouse_name, SUM(units * size) volume
FROM Warehouse W
LEFT JOIN
(
    SELECT product_id, Width * Length * Height size
    FROM Products
) ps
ON W.product_id = ps.product_id
GROUP BY name

### Solution

对每个人做group，sum可以直接计算正负数

```sql
Select u.name, sum(t.amount) As balance
From users u
Left join transactions t
On u.account = t.account
Group by 1
Having balance > 10000
```

using等同于join中的on

```sql
Select name, sum(amount) As balance
From users
Left join transactions
Using(account)
Group by account
Having balance > 10000
```

Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

### Solution

Sub query的效率不如join

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits
WHERE visit_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT visit_id FROM Transactions)
GROUP BY customer_id
```

join

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(Visits.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM visits
LEFT JOIN Transactions
ON Visits.visit_id = Transactions.visit_id
WHERE Transactions.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id

## 1777 Product's Price for Each Store

Table: `Products`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store       | enum    |
| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(product_id,store) is the primary key for this table.
store is an ENUM of type ('store1', 'store2', 'store3') where each represents the store this product is available at.
price is the price of the product at this store.
```

Write an SQL query to find the price of each product in each store.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Products table:
+-------------+--------+-------+
| product_id  | store  | price |
+-------------+--------+-------+
| 0           | store1 | 95    |
| 0           | store3 | 105   |
| 0           | store2 | 100   |
| 1           | store1 | 70    |
| 1           | store3 | 80    |
+-------------+--------+-------+
Result table:
+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
| product_id  | store1 | store2 | store3 |
+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
| 0           | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1           | 70     | null   | 80     |
+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
Product 0 price's are 95 for store1, 100 for store2 and, 105 for store3.
Product 1 price's are 70 for store1, 80 for store3 and, it's not sold in store2.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Products (product_id int, store ENUM('store1', 'store2', 'store3'), price int)
Truncate table Products
insert into Products (product_id, store, price) values ('0', 'store1', '95')
insert into Products (product_id, store, price) values ('0', 'store3', '105')
insert into Products (product_id, store, price) values ('0', 'store2', '100')
insert into Products (product_id, store, price) values ('1', 'store1', '70')
insert into Products (product_id, store, price) values ('1', 'store3', '80')
```

### Solution

## 1484 Group Sold Products By The Date

Table `Activities`:

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contains duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.
```

Write an SQL query to find for each date, the number of distinct products sold and their names.

The sold-products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically. 

Return the result table ordered by `sell_date`.

The query result format is in the following example.

```text
Activities table:
+------------+-------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible       |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt     |
+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |

| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
For 2020-06-02, Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Activities (sell_date date, product varchar(20))
Truncate table Activities
insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-05-30', 'Headphone')
insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-06-01', 'Pencil')
insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-06-02', 'Mask')
insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-05-30', 'Basketball')
insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-06-01', 'Bible')
insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-06-02', 'Mask')
insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-05-30', 'T-Shirt')
```

### Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    #GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC SEPARATOR ',') AS products
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product) AS products
FROM Activities
GROUP BY sell_date;

## 1407 Top Travellers

Table: `Users`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
name is the name of the user.
```

Table: `Rides`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+

| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
Elvis and Lee travelled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveller as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
Bob, Jonathan, Alex and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
Donald didn't have any rides, the distance travelled by him is 0.
```

## 1251 Average Selling Price

Table: `Prices`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
```

Table: `UnitsSold`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units and product_id of each product sold. 
```

Write an SQL query to find the average selling price for each product.

`average_price` should be **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Prices table:

## 1173 Immediate Food Delivery I

Table: `Delivery`

```text
+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
```

If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date then the order is called _immediate_ otherwise it's called _scheduled_.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |

| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+

Result table:
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 33.33                |
+----------------------+
The orders with delivery id 2 and 3 are immediate while the others are scheduled.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Delivery (delivery_id int, customer_id int, order_date date, customer_pref_delivery_date date)
Truncate table Delivery
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('1', '1', '2019-08-01', '2019-08-02')
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('2', '5', '2019-08-02', '2019-08-02')

## 1068 Product Sales Analysis I

Table: `Sales`

```text
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |
+-------------+-------+
(sale_id, year) is the primary key of this table.
product_id is a foreign key to Product table.
Note that the price is per unit.
```

Table: `Product`

```text
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key of this table.
```

Write an SQL query that reports the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` for each `sale_id` in the `Sales` table.

Return the resulting table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Sales table:
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+ 
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |

| Nokia        | 2009  | 5000  |
| Apple        | 2011  | 9000  |
+--------------+-------+-------+
From sale_id = 1, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2008.
From sale_id = 2, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2009.
From sale_id = 7, we can conclude that Apple was sold for 9000 in the year 2011.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table Sales (sale_id int, product_id int, year int, quantity int, price int)
Create table Product (product_id int, product_name varchar(10))

```text
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
```

Write an SQL query that reports the **first login date** for each player.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Activity table:

| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |
+-----------+-------------+
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Activity (player_id int, device_id int, event_date date, games_played int)
Truncate table Activity
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-03-01', '5')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-05-02', '6')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('2', '3', '2017-06-25', '1')

## 613 Shortest Distance in a Line

 Table `point` holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.

 Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.

```text
| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
```

 The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:

```text
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
```

 **Note:** Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table `point`.

 **Follow-up:** What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE If Not Exists point (x INT NOT NULL, UNIQUE INDEX x_UNIQUE (x ASC))
Truncate table point
insert into point (x) values ('-1')
insert into point (x) values ('0')
insert into point (x) values ('2')
```

### Solution

```sql
Select min(a.x - b.x) As shortest
From point a, point b
Where a.x > b.x # 不能是自己跟自己比
```

## 1661 Average Time of Process per Machine

Table: `Activity`

```text
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
```

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the **same number of processes**. Write an SQL query to find the **average time** each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the `'end' timestamp` minus the `'start' timestamp`. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the `machine_id` along with the **average time** as `processing_time`, which should be **rounded to 3 decimal places**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+

Result table:
+------------+-----------------+
| machine_id | processing_time |
+------------+-----------------+
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |
+------------+-----------------+

There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Activity (machine_id int, process_id int, activity_type ENUM('start', 'end'), timestamp float)
Truncate table Activity
insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp) values ('0', '0', 'start', '0.712')
insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp) values ('0', '0', 'end', '1.52')

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp) values ('2', '1', 'end', '5')
```

### Solution

```sql
SELECT s.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(e.timestamp-s.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity s JOIN Activity e ON
    s.machine_id = e.machine_id AND s.process_id = e.process_id AND
    s.activity_type = 'start' AND e.activity_type = 'end'

## 1789 Primary Department for Each Employee

Table: `Employee`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   |  Type   |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.
```

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is `'N'`.

Write an SQL query to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

```text
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |

## 1435 Create a Session Bar Chart

Table: `Sessions`

```text
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| session_id          | int     |
| duration            | int     |
+---------------------+---------+
session_id is the primary key for this table.
duration is the time in seconds that a user has visited the application.
```

You want to know how long a user visits your application. You decided to create bins of "\[0-5&gt;", "\[5-10&gt;", "\[10-15&gt;" and "15 minutes or more" and count the number of sessions on it.

Write an SQL query to report the \(bin, total\) in **any** order.

The query result format is in the following example.

```text
Sessions table:
+-------------+---------------+
| session_id  | duration      |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 30            |
| 2           | 199           |
| 3           | 299           |
| 4           | 580           |
| 5           | 1000          |
+-------------+---------------+

Result table:
+--------------+--------------+
| bin          | total        |
+--------------+--------------+
| [0-5>        | 3            |
| [5-10>       | 1            |
| [10-15>      | 0            |
| 15 or more   | 1            |
+--------------+--------------+

For session_id 1, 2 and 3 have a duration greater or equal than 0 minutes and less than 5 minutes.
For session_id 4 has a duration greater or equal than 5 minutes and less than 10 minutes.
There are no session with a duration greater or equial than 10 minutes and less than 15 minutes.
For session_id 5 has a duration greater or equal than 15 minutes.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Sessions (session_id int, duration int)

## 586 Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders

Table: `Orders`

```text
+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
```

Write an SQL query to find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed **the largest number of orders**.

It is **guaranteed** that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.
```

 **Follow up:** What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the `customer_number` in this case?

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists orders (order_number int, customer_number int)
Truncate table orders
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('1', '1')
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('2', '2')
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('3', '3')
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('4', '3')
```

### Solution

```sql
Select customer_number 
From Orders
Group By customer_number
Order By count(*) desc limit 1
```

Follow Up

```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
HAVING COUNT(order_number) = (
	SELECT COUNT(order_number) cnt
	FROM orders
	GROUP BY customer_number
	ORDER BY cnt DESC
	LIMIT 1
)
```

+---------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID and the name of one student in the school.
```

Table: `Subjects`

```text
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+

```text
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| student_id   | int     |
| subject_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each student from the Students table takes every course from Subjects table.
Each row of this table indicates that a student with ID student_id attended the exam of subject_name.
```

Write an SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Order the result table by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Students table:
+------------+--------------+

## 584 Find Customer Referee

Given a table `customer` holding customers information and the referee.

```text
+------+------+-----------+
| id   | name | referee_id|
+------+------+-----------+
|    1 | Will |      NULL |
|    2 | Jane |      NULL |
|    3 | Alex |         2 |
|    4 | Bill |      NULL |
|    5 | Zack |         1 |
|    6 | Mark |         2 |
+------+------+-----------+
```

Write a query to return the list of customers **NOT** referred by the person with id '2'.

For the sample data above, the result is:

```text
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer (id INT,name VARCHAR(25),referee_id INT);
Truncate table customer
insert into customer (id, name, referee_id) values ('1', 'Will', 'None')
insert into customer (id, name, referee_id) values ('2', 'Jane', 'None')
insert into customer (id, name, referee_id) values ('3', 'Alex', '2')
insert into customer (id, name, referee_id) values ('4', 'Bill', 'None')
insert into customer (id, name, referee_id) values ('5', 'Zack', '1')
insert into customer (id, name, referee_id) values ('6', 'Mark', '2')
```

### Solution

| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+

Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |

| seller_id   |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Both sellers with id 1 and 3 sold products with the most total price of 2800.
```

### Schema

```sql

| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+
The only pair is (1, 1) where they cooperated exactly 3 times.
```
