## 620 Not Boring Movies

 X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the moviesâ€™ ratings and descriptions.

Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.

For example, table `cinema`:

```text
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```

For the example above, the output should be:

```text
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists cinema (id int, movie varchar(255), description varchar(255), rating float(2, 1))
Truncate table cinema
insert into cinema (id, movie, description, rating) values ('1', 'War', 'great 3D', '8.9')
insert into cinema (id, movie, description, rating) values ('2', 'Science', 'fiction', '8.5')
insert into cinema (id, movie, description, rating) values ('3', 'irish', 'boring', '6.2')
insert into cinema (id, movie, description, rating) values ('4', 'Ice song', 'Fantacy', '8.6')
insert into cinema (id, movie, description, rating) values ('5', 'House card', 'Interesting', '9.1')
```

### Solution

```sql
Select *
From cinema
Where description not like '%boring%' # description <> 'boring'
And id % 2 != 0
Order by rating DESC
```

## 1211 Queries Quality and Percentage

Table: `Queries`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
```

We define query `quality` as:

> The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define `poor query percentage` as:

> The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write an SQL query to find each `query_name`, the `quality` and `poor_query_percentage`.

Both `quality` and `poor_query_percentage` should be **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+

Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Queries (query_name varchar(30), result varchar(50), position int, rating int)
Truncate table Queries
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Dog', 'Golden Retriever', '1', '5')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Dog', 'German Shepherd', '2', '5')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Dog', 'Mule', '200', '1')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Cat', 'Shirazi', '5', '2')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Cat', 'Siamese', '3', '3')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Cat', 'Sphynx', '7', '4')
```

### Solution

```sql
SELECT 
	query_name,
	ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality,
	ROUND(AVG(rating < 3) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage 
FROM 
	Queries
GROUP BY 
	query_name
```

## 1677 Product's Worth Over Invoices

Table: `Product`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of the product. The name consists of only lowercase English letters. No two products have the same name.
```

Table: `Invoice`

```text
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| invoice_id  | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| rest        | int  |
| paid        | int  |
| canceled    | int  |
| refunded    | int  |
+-------------+------+
invoice_id is the primary key for this table and the id of this invoice.
product_id is the id of the product for this invoice.
rest is the amount left to pay for this invoice.
paid is the amount paid for this invoice.
canceled is the amount canceled for this invoice.
refunded is the amount refunded for this invoice.
```

Write an SQL query that will, for all products, return each product name with total amount due, paid, canceled, and refunded across all invoices.

Return the result table ordered by `product_name`.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Product table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | name  |
+------------+-------+
| 0          | ham   |
| 1          | bacon |
+------------+-------+
Invoice table:
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
| invoice_id | product_id | rest | paid | canceled | refunded |
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
| 23         | 0          | 2    | 0    | 5        | 0        |
| 12         | 0          | 0    | 4    | 0        | 3        |
| 1          | 1          | 1    | 1    | 0        | 1        |
| 2          | 1          | 1    | 0    | 1        | 1        |
| 3          | 1          | 0    | 1    | 1        | 1        |
| 4          | 1          | 1    | 1    | 1        | 0        |
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
Result table:
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
| name  | rest | paid | canceled | refunded |
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
| bacon | 3    | 3    | 3        | 3        |
| ham   | 2    | 4    | 5        | 3        |
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
- The amount of money left to pay for bacon is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money paid for bacon is 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money canceled for bacon is 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money refunded for bacon is 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3
- The amount of money left to pay for ham is 2 + 0 = 2
- The amount of money paid for ham is 0 + 4 = 4
- The amount of money canceled for ham is 5 + 0 = 5
- The amount of money refunded for ham is 0 + 3 = 3
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Product(product_id int, name varchar(15))
Create table If Not Exists Invoice(invoice_id int,product_id int,rest int, paid int, canceled int, refunded int)
Truncate table Product
insert into Product (product_id, name) values ('0', 'ham')
insert into Product (product_id, name) values ('1', 'bacon')
Truncate table Invoice
insert into Invoice (invoice_id, product_id, rest, paid, canceled, refunded) values ('23', '0', '2', '0', '5', '0')

insert into Invoice (invoice_id, product_id, rest, paid, canceled, refunded) values ('4', '1', '1', '1', '1', '0')
```

### Solution

```sql
# 1.Use GROUP BY to group results by product (product_id or product_name in mysql and product_name in other RDBMS)
# 2.Use ORDER BY to order the results
# 3.Use Sum to aggregate the values
SELECT 
    p.name AS name, 
	sum(i.rest) AS rest,
	sum(i.paid) AS paid, 
	sum(i.canceled) AS canceled, 
	sum(i.refunded) AS refunded 
FROM Product p INNER JOIN Invoice i ON p.product_id = i.product_id 
GROUP BY p.product_id 
ORDER BY p.name;
```

## 1809 Ad-Free Sessions 

Table: `Playback`

```text
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| session_id  | int  |
| customer_id | int  |
| start_time  | int  |
| end_time    | int  |
+-------------+------+
session_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_id is the ID of the customer watching this session.
The session runs during the inclusive interval between start_time and end_time.
It is guaranteed that start_time <= end_time and that two sessions for the same customer do not intersect.
```

Table: `Ads`

```text
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| ad_id       | int  |
| customer_id | int  |
| timestamp   | int  |
+-------------+------+
ad_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_id is the ID of the customer viewing this ad.
timestamp is the moment of time at which the ad was shown.
```

Write an SQL query to report all the sessions that did not get shown any ads.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Playback table:
+------------+-------------+------------+----------+
| session_id | customer_id | start_time | end_time |
+------------+-------------+------------+----------+
| 1          | 1           | 1          | 5        |
| 2          | 1           | 15         | 23       |
| 3          | 2           | 10         | 12       |
| 4          | 2           | 17         | 28       |
| 5          | 2           | 2          | 8        |
+------------+-------------+------------+----------+

Ads table:
+-------+-------------+-----------+
| ad_id | customer_id | timestamp |
+-------+-------------+-----------+
| 1     | 1           | 5         |
| 2     | 2           | 17        |
| 3     | 2           | 20        |
+-------+-------------+-----------+

Result table:
+------------+
| session_id |
+------------+
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 5          |
+------------+
The ad with ID 1 was shown to user 1 at time 5 while they were in session 1.
The ad with ID 2 was shown to user 2 at time 17 while they were in session 4.
The ad with ID 3 was shown to user 2 at time 20 while they were in session 4.
We can see that sessions 1 and 4 had at least one ad. Sessions 2, 3, and 5 did not have any ads, so we return them.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Playback(session_id int,customer_id int,start_time int,end_time int)
Create table If Not Exists Ads (ad_id int, customer_id int, timestamp int)
Truncate table Playback
insert into Playback (session_id, customer_id, start_time, end_time) values ('1', '1', '1', '5')
insert into Playback (session_id, customer_id, start_time, end_time) values ('2', '1', '15', '23')
insert into Playback (session_id, customer_id, start_time, end_time) values ('3', '2', '10', '12')

insert into Ads (ad_id, customer_id, timestamp) values ('2', '2', '17')
insert into Ads (ad_id, customer_id, timestamp) values ('3', '2', '20')
```

### Solution

```sql
SELECT session_id
FROM playback pb 
LEFT JOIN ads ad
ON pb.customer_id = ad.customer_id AND ad.timestamp BETWEEN start_time and end_time
WHERE ad.customer_id IS NULL
```

## 1543 Fix Product Name Format

Table: `Sales`

```text
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| sale_id      | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| sale_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
sale_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold.
```

Since table Sales was filled manually in the year `2000`, `product_name` may contain leading and/or trailing white spaces, also they are case-insensitive.

Write an SQL query to report

* `product_name` in lowercase without leading or trailing white spaces.
* `sale_date` in the format `('YYYY-MM')`.
* `total` the number of times the product was sold in this month.

Return the result table ordered by `product_name` in **ascending order**. In case of a tie, order it by `sale_date` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

```text
Sales
+---------+--------------+------------+
| sale_id | product_name | sale_date  |
+---------+--------------+------------+
| 1       | LCPHONE      | 2000-01-16 |
| 2       | LCPhone      | 2000-01-17 |
| 3       | LcPhOnE      | 2000-02-18 |
| 4       | LCKeyCHAiN   | 2000-02-19 |
| 5       | LCKeyChain   | 2000-02-28 |
| 6       | Matryoshka   | 2000-03-31 |
+---------+--------------+------------+

Result table:
+--------------+-----------+-------+
| product_name | sale_date | total |
+--------------+-----------+-------+
| lckeychain   | 2000-02   | 2     |
| lcphone      | 2000-01   | 2     |
| lcphone      | 2000-02   | 1     |
| matryoshka   | 2000-03   | 1     |
+--------------+-----------+-------+
In January, 2 LcPhones were sold, please note that the product names are not case sensitive and may contain spaces.
In Februery, 2 LCKeychains and 1 LCPhone were sold.
In March, 1 matryoshka was sold.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Sales (sale_id int, product_name varchar(30), sale_date date)
Truncate table Sales
insert into Sales (sale_id, product_name, sale_date) values ('1', 'LCPHONE', '2000-01-16')
insert into Sales (sale_id, product_name, sale_date) values ('2', 'LCPhone', '2000-01-17')
insert into Sales (sale_id, product_name, sale_date) values ('3', 'LcPhOnE', '2000-02-18')
insert into Sales (sale_id, product_name, sale_date) values ('4', 'LCKeyCHAiN', '2000-02-19')
insert into Sales (sale_id, product_name, sale_date) values ('5', 'LCKeyChain', '2000-02-28')
insert into Sales (sale_id, product_name, sale_date) values ('6', 'Matryoshka', '2000-03-31')
```

### Solution

```sql
SELECT LOWER(TRIM(product_name)) As product_name, DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, "%Y-%m") sale_date, count(sale_id) total
FROM sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

## 1294 Weather Type in Each Country 

Table: `Countries`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| country_id    | int     |
| country_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
country_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID and the name of one country.
```

Table: `Weather`

```text
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| country_id    | int     |
| weather_state | varchar |
| day           | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(country_id, day) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the weather state in a country for one day.
```

Write an SQL query to find the type of weather in each country for November 2019.

The type of weather is **Cold** if the average `weather_state` is less than or equal 15, **Hot** if the average `weather_state` is greater than or equal 25 and **Warm** otherwise.

Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text

| China        | Warm         |
| Morocco      | Hot          |
+--------------+--------------+
Average weather_state in USA in November is (15) / 1 = 15 so weather type is Cold.
Average weather_state in Austraila in November is (-2 + 0 + 3) / 3 = 0.333 so weather type is Cold.
Average weather_state in Peru in November is (25) / 1 = 25 so weather type is Hot.
Average weather_state in China in November is (16 + 18 + 21) / 3 = 18.333 so weather type is Warm.
Average weather_state in Morocco in November is (25 + 27 + 31) / 3 = 27.667 so weather type is Hot.
We know nothing about average weather_state in Spain in November so we don't include it in the result table.

```

### Solution

```sql
SELECT a.country_name,
CASE 
    WHEN AVG(weather_state)<=15 THEN "Cold"
    WHEN AVG(weather_State)>=25 THEN "Hot"
    ELSE "Warm"
END
AS weather_type 
FROM Countries AS a
JOIN Weather AS b
ON a.country_id = b.country_id
WHERE MONTH(b.day) = 11
GROUP BY a.country_id
```

## 1075 Project Employees I

Table: `Project`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
```

Table: `Employee`

```text
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table.
```

Write an SQL query that reports the **average** experience years of all the employees for each project, **rounded to 2 digits**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Project (project_id int, employee_id int)
Create table If Not Exists Employee (employee_id int, name varchar(10), experience_years int)
Truncate table Project
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '1')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '2')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '3')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('2', '1')
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('2', '4')
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('1', 'Khaled', '3')
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('2', 'Ali', '2')
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('3', 'John', '1')
insert into Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) values ('4', 'Doe', '2')
```

### Solution

```sql
Select project_id, round(avg(experience_years), 2) As average_years
From project p
Left Join Employee e On p.employee_id = e.employee_id
Group By 1
```
